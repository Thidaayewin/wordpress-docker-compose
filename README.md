How Docker Compose Works Internally!
-----------------------------------

docker compose up -d


   ↓
Create Docker Network
 Docker automatically sets up a default network so containers can talk to each other.


   ↓
Start db (MySQL)
Pulls the mysql:8.0 image, builds the container, initializes database files,
creates the 'wordpress' database, and sets up a user/password.


   ↓
Start wordpress (App)
Pulls the wordpress:latest image, builds the container, connects to MySQL on port 3306,
verifies credentials, and installs WordPress tables.

   ↓
Start phpMyAdmin (UI)
Pulls the phpmyadmin:latest image, builds the container, connects to the same database,
and exposes the admin panel at localhost:8081.


   ↓
Running State
WordPress available at localhost:8080
phpMyAdmin available at localhost:8081
MySQL running internally on the Docker network
